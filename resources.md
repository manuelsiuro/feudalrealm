# Feudal Realm Manager: Resource Visual Designs (Simple 3D Shapes)

This document outlines the visual design for each resource in Feudal Realm Manager, using only simple 3D geometric shapes (cubes, cuboids, pyramids, cylinders, spheres, cones) and distinct colors. The aim is for clear, distinguishable items that can be easily identified when carried by serfs or stockpiled.

## Raw Materials

### 1. Wood (Logs)

- **Type:** Raw Material
- **Visual Description:**
    - **Shape:** Medium-length Cylinder.
    - **Color:** Medium Brown. The circular ends of the cylinder can be a slightly lighter brown to suggest cut wood.
    - **Arrangement:** Often seen carried singly or in small stacks (e.g., 2-3 logs bundled).
- **Notes:** Should be clearly distinguishable from Planks.

### 2. Stone

- **Type:** Raw Material
- **Visual Description:**
    - **Shape:** Small, roughly cuboid or a slightly irregular cube (a basic cube is sufficient).
    - **Color:** Light to Medium Grey.
    - **Arrangement:** Carried singly or seen in piles.
- **Notes:** Represents a rough block of quarried stone.

### 3. Grain

- **Type:** Raw Material
- **Visual Description:**
    - **Shape:** A small, tied sack represented by a slightly rounded, upright cuboid or a squat cylinder, cinched at the top (a smaller cylinder or sphere). Alternatively, a simple ovoid.
    - **Color:** Light Beige or Golden Yellow.
    - **Arrangement:** Carried as a single sack.
- **Notes:** Represents a unit of harvested grain.

### 4. Fish

- **Type:** Raw Material (Food)
- **Visual Description:**
    - **Shape:** A simple, elongated, flattened ovoid. Alternatively, two triangles joined at their base (one larger for the body, one smaller for the tail fin).
    - **Color:** Silvery Blue or Light Grey.
    - **Arrangement:** Carried singly or a few together.
- **Notes:** Should be clearly identifiable as aquatic life.

### 5. Iron Ore

- **Type:** Raw Material
- **Visual Description:**
    - **Shape:** Small, irregular lumpy sphere or a rough-edged small cube.
    - **Color:** Rusty Red-Brown.
    - **Arrangement:** Carried as individual lumps or seen in piles.
- **Notes:** Distinguished by its reddish-brown color.

### 6. Coal Ore

- **Type:** Raw Material
- **Visual Description:**
    - **Shape:** Small, irregular lumpy sphere or a rough-edged small cube.
    - **Color:** Dull Black or Very Dark Grey.
    - **Arrangement:** Carried as individual lumps or seen in piles.
- **Notes:** Distinguished by its black/dark grey color.

### 7. Gold Ore

- **Type:** Raw Material
- **Visual Description:**
    - **Shape:** Small, irregular lumpy sphere or a rough-edged small cube. May have slightly more "jagged" edges than other ores if easily achievable.
    - **Color:** Dull Yellow, possibly with a few tiny flecks of Light Grey or Brown to distinguish it from pure Gold Bars.
    - **Arrangement:** Carried as individual lumps or seen in piles.
- **Notes:** Distinguished by its dull yellow color and unrefined appearance.

## Processed Goods

### 8. Planks (Lumber)

- **Type:** Processed Good
- **Visual Description:**
    - **Shape:** Thin, flat, rectangular cuboid.
    - **Color:** Light Brown.
    - **Arrangement:** Carried singly or in small, neat stacks.
- **Notes:** Clearly distinct from raw Wood (Logs) by its processed, flat shape.

### 9. Flour

- **Type:** Processed Good
- **Visual Description:**
    - **Shape:** A small, tied sack (similar to Grain, but potentially a different color or slightly different sack shape for distinction if Grain is also a sack). A rounded cuboid with a pinched top or a simple sphere.
    - **Color:** Off-White or Very Light Cream.
    - **Arrangement:** Carried as a single sack.
- **Notes:** Differentiated from Grain by color.

### 10. Bread

- **Type:** Processed Good (Food)
- **Visual Description:**
    - **Shape:** Small, slightly elongated rounded cuboid or ovoid, resembling a simple loaf.
    - **Color:** Golden Brown.
    - **Arrangement:** Carried as individual loaves.
- **Notes:** Recognizable food item.

### 11. Meat (Pork)

- **Type:** Processed Good (Food)
- **Visual Description:**
    - **Shape:** A reddish-pink, slightly irregular cuboid or a thick, curved ovoid (haunch shape).
    - **Color:** Pinkish-Red.
    - **Arrangement:** Carried as individual pieces.
- **Notes:** Represents a butchered piece of meat.

### 12. Iron Bars

- **Type:** Processed Good
- **Visual Description:**
    - **Shape:** Small, relatively thin, rectangular cuboid (ingot shape).
    - **Color:** Dark Metallic Grey.
    - **Arrangement:** Carried singly or in small stacks/bundles.
- **Notes:** Smooth and regular shape compared to Iron Ore.

### 13. Gold Bars

- **Type:** Processed Good
- **Visual Description:**
    - **Shape:** Small, relatively thin, rectangular cuboid (ingot shape). Could have slightly trapezoidal sides for a classic ingot look if simple to implement.
    - **Color:** Bright, Shiny Yellow.
    - **Arrangement:** Carried singly or in small stacks/bundles.
- **Notes:** Clearly distinct from Gold Ore by its refined shape and bright color.

### 14. Tools

- **Type:** Processed Good (Consumed by professions)
- **Notes:** Tools are distinct items. They are carried individually.

    - **Axe:**
        - **Shape:** Small, dark grey flat cuboid (blade edge) attached to a slightly wider dark grey cuboid (head body), connected to a thin brown cylinder (handle).
        - **Color:** Dark Grey (head), Brown (handle).
    - **Pickaxe:**
        - **Shape:** Small, dark grey cuboid with one or two pointed ends (cone or pyramid tip), attached perpendicularly to a thin brown cylinder (handle).
        - **Color:** Dark Grey (head), Brown (handle).
    - **Scythe:**
        - **Shape:** Long, thin brown cylinder (handle). Attached to one end is a thin, curved, flat grey cuboid (blade).
        - **Color:** Brown (handle), Grey (blade).
    - **Hammer:**
        - **Shape:** Small grey cuboid (head) attached perpendicularly to a thin brown cylinder (handle). One face of the head cuboid could be slightly rounded.
        - **Color:** Grey (head), Brown (handle).
    - **Fishing Rod:**
        - **Shape:** Long, thin brown cylinder, possibly slightly tapered.
        - **Color:** Brown. (Optionally, a tiny blue sphere at the tip).

### 15. Swords

- **Type:** Processed Good (Military)
- **Visual Description:**
    - **Shape:** Long, thin, flat grey cuboid (blade). A small, perpendicular brown or black cuboid forms the crossguard. A short brown or black cylinder forms the hilt, possibly topped with a tiny sphere as a pommel.
    - **Color:** Grey (blade), Brown/Black (hilt/guard).
- **Arrangement:** Carried singly.

### 16. Shields

- **Type:** Processed Good (Military)
- **Visual Description:**
    - **Shape:** A flat, square or circular thin cuboid. For a more "shield" look, a slightly convex front could be a very low-poly dome on a flat cylinder base. Simplest is a flat square/circular plate.
    - **Color:** Wooden Brown or Medium Grey. (Optionally, a small dot of player color in the center).
- **Arrangement:** Carried singly.

## Live Animals (as Resources)

### 17. Pigs

- **Type:** Animal Resource (input for Slaughterhouse)
- **Visual Description:**
    - **Shape:** A pink, oblong, rounded cuboid or ovoid for the body. Four very short, stubby pink cylinders for legs. A tiny pink sphere or very short cylinder for a snout. Two tiny pink triangles for ears.
    - **Color:** Pink.
    - **Arrangement:** Serfs would visually guide/herd this (represented by the serf carrying a "lead rope" sprite, and the pig model moving nearby).
- **Notes:** This is a mobile resource unit until it reaches the Slaughterhouse.

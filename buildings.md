# Feudal Realm Manager: Building Visual Designs (Simple 3D Shapes)

This document outlines the visual design for each building in Feudal Realm Manager, using only simple 3D geometric shapes (cubes, cuboids, pyramids, cylinders, spheres, cones) and distinct colors. No complex shapes or textures are to be used. The aim is for clear, distinguishable structures that hint at their function.

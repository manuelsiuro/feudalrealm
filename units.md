# Feudal Realm Manager: Unit Visual Designs (Simple 3D Shapes)

This document outlines the visual design for each unit type in Feudal Realm Manager, using only simple 3D geometric shapes (cubes, cuboids, pyramids, cylinders, spheres, cones) and distinct colors. The aim is for clear, distinguishable units that hint at their profession or role. All units will have a base "body" and "head" shape, with profession-specific additions.

## Base Serf Model

All serf professions will share a common base model to which profession-specific elements are added.

- **Body:**
    - **Shape:** Upright, medium-height, slightly rounded cuboid or a simple cylinder.
    - **Color:** A neutral color representing basic clothing (e.g., Light Brown, Beige, or Light Grey).
- **Head:**
    - **Shape:** Sphere or a slightly rounded cube, placed on top of the body.
    - **Color:** A simple "skin tone" (e.g., Light Peach or Tan).
- **Limbs (Implied/Simplified):** For simplicity, distinct arms and legs might be omitted or represented by very subtle bulges or slight color variations on the body cuboid/cylinder. Focus will be on distinguishing features and carried items.
